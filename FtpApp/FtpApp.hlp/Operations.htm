<h1>FTP App Operations</h1>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Body" -->

<h2><img src="Images/NewSite.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Create Web Site Database</h2>
<p>
Create a new database entry for a web site.  Requires the path to the local files, a name for the web site, the
ftp name of the web site ftp address without the ftp prefix (e.g. "swde.com"), the user id to web host for the web site ftp access and the
password for the ftp access.
</p>
<h2><img src="Images/PickSite.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Pick a Web Site from List</h2>
<p>
Once the web site database has been created, one can switch from one database file to another with this
operation.  A list of web site databases is given in a dialog box and the user may select one.
</p>
<p>
Note:  The last database is opened when the application starts up.  This command allows the user
to choose another website to process.
</p>

<h2><img src="Images/Compare.jpg" width="16" height="15">
Compare Current Files with Files in the Last Update</h2>
<p>
Creates a list of all the files in the web site that are new, changed, need retrieving from the web
host or need deleting on the web host.  It does this be creating a new list of all the files on the
web site and in the local version of the web site including the size and date in both places and
comparing the new list with the old list.  Then it is compared to an earlier version of the database.
For example, when a file in the local web site list changes its date or size the file is "put" to the
remote site.  For files that exist on the web host and on the local disk the sizes and dates are
compared.  Note that the comparison is made with the local file attributes saved after the last
update to the web host.
</p>

<h2><img src="Images/GetSite.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Get Files from Web Host</h2>
<p>
Pick a web site from the list.  At this point the list of files at the web host is retrieved.  The next step
is to Confirm the Updates, choosing one or more files to download from the web host.
</p>
<h2><img src="Images/ConfirmUpdate.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Confirm Updates</h2>
<p>
The list of changes or updates produced by the either the Compare or Get commands is presented in a dialog box with
check boxes by each entry.  The operation is indicated for each file. One can check one or more
entries to update or select the button that will select all the entries.
</p>
<p>
The ftp operations are performed and then the database is updated to reflect the new state of the
web site local and remote files.  Finally the database is saved.
</p>

<h2><img src="Images/PrintSite.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Print</h2>
<p>
Will do all the normal things to print the current content of the window.
</p>

<h2><img src="Images/Options.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Options</h2>
<p>
The options dialog allows specifying the Display and Printer Font Size Scale Factor, the printer
orientation and the printer margins.
</p>

<h2><img src="Images/DeleteSiteData.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Delete Web Site Data</h2>
<p>
Delete the current web site data.  The local web site is not distrubed nor is the remote site.
</p>

<h2><img src="Images/About.jpg" width="16" height="15"> About</h2>
<p>
Displays the About Box.  The about box uses text from the resource file (TestApp.rc) for
the output information.  There is a standard about box dialog in the Library.
</p>

<h2><img src="Images/Exit.jpg" width="16" height="15"> Exit</h2>
<p>Exit the application with no reservations.</p>
